1. I was able to correctly create all the required html and css files and put them on github and then get this site available from http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~aendo01/.
2. I went to office hours and Philip Wang helped me, particularly with getting my tufts site to redirect to my github.
3. I spent about 10 hours on this assignment.
