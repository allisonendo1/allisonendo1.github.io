      <h3>University of California, San Diego - Summer Intern, The Design Lab (Summer 2017)</h3>
      </div>
    <p>I conducted a study with a PhD. student where we examined how professional designers capture, manage, retrieve and collaborate on their ideas. We were particularly interested in how certain archiving platforms, like Evernote and Google Drive contribute to the design process and how these tools can be improved upon. Using the results we got from our interview study, I co-authored a paper that was submitted to CHI 2018. In addition, I also served on the Marketing and Communications Team for Design for San Diego, a civic challenge focused on improving mobility in San Diego. My main contribution to this project was coming up with a more visually appealing and functional interface for the website.</p>

      <h3>Tufts University - Student Marketing Consultant, The Tufts Career Center (Fall 2017)</h3>
      </div>
    <p>I conducted a semester-long project with a team of five other students to improve the Tufts Career Center's marketing and outreach efforts. We began our market research by interviewing 80 current Tufts students to get suggestions on how The Career Center could improve their services and outreach methods. We also conducted comparative research to see what other services/outreach methods other schools utilize. We then used our comparative research to develop a comprehensive 3-year marketing plan that included suggestions on a variety of marketing tactics, such as blogging, email, events, social media, and branding.</p>

      </div>
	<p>This lab studies the efficacy of computer-based treatments on depression and anxiety, and uses two methods to measure treatment efficacy. I was in charge of collecting and managing this data, validating this data, and running statistical analyses to test study hypotheses for these two measures. I also assessed the lab's inter-rater reliability and helped imrpove this measure. During the Summer of 2016, I contin
	  ued my work on BAT Operations. I worked to pioneer a more efficient system that promoted the prompt rating of videos so that data could be collected and analyzed in a shorter time frame.</p>
